# Dissertation-Repo
This is the ultimate repository for all the code, packages, and methodology used for my dissertation. The Dissertation itself is an attempt to build a 1D CNN in order to classify which type of chaos dominates a given time series.
Built from scratch I did the data generation in Julia, CNN architecture and training in Python, structured as a series of self-contained notebooks. This is so that it's easy to track my though process along the way, as well as give me any advice you can give along the way
I love criticism so any tips will be greatly appreciated.

Hopefully along the way I can add a quanitfier of the amount of choas I have rather than it just being a discrete process.
-For now Project 0 talks about the importance of the project and the architecure that I intend to build for the entire process.
